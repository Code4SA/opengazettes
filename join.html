				<h2>Why are gazettes important?</h2>
				<!--<img src="img/icons/treasure.png" width="10%" alt="Why are gazettes important?" title="Why are gazettes important?" />-->
				<p>The Government Gazettes are an official record of South Africa and communicate some of the most important information about the country. And yet, many people cannot find this information or must pay to access it.</p>

				<h2>What's in a gazette?</h2>
				<!--<img src="img/icons/file.png" width="10%" alt="What's in a gazette?" title="What's in a gazette?" />-->
				<p>Gazettes contain information like government announcements, by-laws, name changes, corporate agreements and liquidations, land claims, court orders, tenders and more. </p>

				<h2>How can you help?</h2>
				<!--<img src="img/icons/fists.png" width="10%" alt="How can you help?" title="How can you help?" />-->
				<p>Weâ€™re looking for Government and Provincial Gazettes from before 2012, especially from before 1980. Print or digital (PDF) are both great.</p>
